"""sweep_notifications task — claim pending notification rows and dispatch them.

The sweeper implements the outbox-pattern fan-out for the notifications table.
Celery beat schedules it every ``JOBIFY_NOTIFY_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS``
(see ``jobify_worker.celery_app.beat_schedule``); it is also callable on demand.
Multiple concurrent sweeper instances are safe: ``SKIP LOCKED``
ensures each one-at-a-time claim owns a distinct row.

State machine per row:
    pending -> dispatching -> sent      (success path)
    pending -> dispatching -> pending   (transient failure, attempts < 5)
    pending -> dispatching -> failed    (max attempts reached)

The task does NOT use Celery autoretry for the per-notification failures —
retries are handled inside _dispatch_one via the send_after backoff formula.
The broad except around _dispatch_one ensures one bad notification never
aborts the rest of the batch.
