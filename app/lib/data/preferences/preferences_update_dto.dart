/// Request body for PATCH /v1/applicants/me/preferences. This is a FULL-FORM
/// DTO: both callers (PreferencesScreen, EditProfileScreen) are full-form
/// editors, so every field is always sent — an explicit `null` CLEARS
/// `desired_role`/`expected_ctc` on the server, and an empty `locations`
/// list clears locations (the key is non-nullable on the wire). The one
/// exception is `desiredRole == DesiredRole.unknown` (the server sent a role
/// this app build doesn't recognise): the key is OMITTED so saving preserves
/// the server value instead of clearing it.
///
/// `language` is ALWAYS sent too (no "clear" semantics — it's always one of
/// "en"/"hi"). Every caller that doesn't offer a language switcher (the two
/// form screens) must seed it from the currently-loaded `PreferencesDto` and
/// pass it through unchanged; only the Profile screen's language switcher
/// changes it.
///
/// toJson() is hand-written, not code-generated: `@JsonSerializable(
/// includeIfNull: false)` on this project's installed json_serializable +
/// Dart SDK combination emits generated code using the "null-aware
/// elements" collection-literal syntax (`'key': ?value`), which this
/// project's declared language version (pubspec.yaml `sdk: ^3.6.0`) does
/// not support — build_runner fails with a FormatterException. A
/// hand-written toJson() avoids the codegen path entirely.
