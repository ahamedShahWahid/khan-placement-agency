"""Guard test (P2.5b) — DSR PII-table coverage symmetry.

Pure reflection over the two DSR modules' namespaces; no DB, no app boot.

Why this exists (see memory "New PII table -> DSR coverage"): a new table
holding user PII must be wired into BOTH the DSR export builder
(`jobify_api.dsr.build_user_export`) and the DSR delete orchestrator
(`jobify_api.dsr.deleter.delete_user_data`). Adding it to one but not the
other — or to neither — is a DPDP gap that design review keeps missing.

Observable chosen: the set of ORM mapped classes each module *references*
(imported into its namespace). The modules don't expose a clean enumerable
of "covered tables", and re-parsing source is brittle; but every model a
module imports is genuinely used (ruff F401 forbids unused imports, enforced
in CI), so the imported-model set is a reliable, non-source-parsing proxy
for "tables this module touches". We then assert each module's referenced
PII tables equal an EXPLICIT expected set, after subtracting the documented
intentional asymmetries below.

Failure modes this catches:
  * add a new PII table to BOTH modules but forget to pin it here -> both
    equality assertions fail until EXPECTED_PII_TABLES is updated;
  * add a PII table to ONE module only -> the asymmetric module's set no
    longer equals EXPECTED -> fails, naming the table;
  * remove a PII table from either module -> fails, naming the table.
