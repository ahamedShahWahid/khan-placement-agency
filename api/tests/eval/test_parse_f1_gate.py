"""Parse F1 quality gate (spec §13 P1).

Runs the eval harness against the gold dataset in ``api/data/parse_eval/``
and asserts the parser stays above the per-field floors AND the overall
target. Print full breakdown on failure to make diagnosis cheap.

Gate config:
- Overall macro-F1 >= 0.85 (spec P2 target; ratchet to 0.90 before launch).
- Per-field floors: email 0.95, phone 0.85, name 0.70, skills 0.75.

Marked ``@pytest.mark.eval`` so it runs only when explicitly requested:
``uv run pytest -m eval``. CI runs this separately from the unit + integration
suites.
