"""DSR delete orchestrator — DPDP § 12 erasure right.

Walks the user's data graph and applies the brainstorm-locked strategy:
"hard-delete PII, keep anonymized aggregates." See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-dsr-delete-design.md §2 for the
per-table policy table and §5 for the order of operations.

Pure executor — does NOT write audit rows. The route handler writes
``user.dsr_delete_requested`` BEFORE this call and
``user.dsr_deleted`` AFTER, in the same transaction.

It DOES redact PII out of existing ``audit_logs.context`` values — see
:func:`_redact_audit_context_pii`. That is the one place this module UPDATEs
``audit_logs``, and it is required by IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC §9.2
("anonymize audit records (keep action/timestamp, drop actor PII)").
