"""Append-only audit substrate for P4 DPDP.

The single entry point is `audit_log()`. It writes one row to `audit_logs`
inside the caller's transaction. There is no commit, no flush-and-discard,
no fire-and-forget dispatch — the row is exactly as durable as the business
action it records. If the caller's txn rolls back, the audit row rolls back
too. That is the contract.

Action slugs are dotted, lowercase, verb-past
(`resume.accessed`, `consent.granted`). See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-28-audit-logs-substrate-design.md §4 for the
reserved namespace.
