"""Base types for notification channel adapters.

``EmailChannel`` is a structural Protocol — any class with a matching
``send`` signature satisfies it without inheriting. This keeps the adapters
decoupled from the base module and makes ``google.genai`` / ``boto3`` imports
lazy (the impl modules are never imported unless the specific channel is
selected).

``ChannelResult`` is the unified return value from every adapter call.
Adapters MUST return a ``ChannelResult`` for expected failures (network
blip, 4xx from the provider) and MUST only raise on programming errors or
fatal configuration issues.
