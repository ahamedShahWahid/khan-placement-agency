"""sweep_notifications task — claim pending notification rows and dispatch them.

The sweeper implements the outbox-pattern fan-out for the notifications table.
It is designed to be called on demand (or via Celery Beat when worker infra
hardens). Multiple concurrent sweeper instances are safe: ``SKIP LOCKED``
ensures disjoint batches.

State machine per row:
    pending -> dispatching -> sent      (success path)
    pending -> dispatching -> pending   (transient failure, attempts < 5)
    pending -> dispatching -> failed    (max attempts reached)

The task does NOT use Celery autoretry for the per-notification failures —
retries are handled inside _dispatch_one via the send_after backoff formula.
The broad except around _dispatch_one ensures one bad notification never
aborts the rest of the batch.
