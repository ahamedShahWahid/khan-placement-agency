"""Gemini-backed ResumeParser — one structured-output call over extracted text.

This module imports ``google.genai`` at module load time. Everything else in
the parser package stays genai-free (mirrors ``jobify.scoring.llm_explainer``);
never re-export this class from the package ``__init__``.

Failure contract: any post-extraction failure (provider exception, blocked or
empty response, JSON that fails ``ParsedResume`` validation) raises
:class:`LlmParserError` after logging a PII-safe SHAPE summary at debug (see
``_raw_shape`` — never the response body, which restates the resume).
ONE attempt, no internal retry — :class:`FallbackResumeParser` is the recovery.
Extraction failures (:class:`ParserError` from ``extract_text``) propagate
untouched: they are permanent regardless of parser.

One call shape: ``parse``/``parse_text``, the interactive LIVE path (async,
one ``generate_content`` call) — never move it off interactive, the spec's
≤10-min first-match criterion depends on its latency.

A ``parse_texts_batch`` Gemini Batch API path existed here for the eval lane
(50% pricing, separate quota pool) and was removed 2026-08-15: it had no
caller once the eval lane moved to the paced interactive path, and it was
never verified against the real API (batch returned FAILED_PRECONDITION on
the free tier, then 403 once the project was denied). Recover from git
history if bulk re-parsing becomes real — but verify it live before trusting
it, since its only coverage was mocked.
