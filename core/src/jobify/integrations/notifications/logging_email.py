"""Stub email channel that logs the would-be email payload via structlog.

Used for local/dev environments. Set ``JOBIFY_EMAIL_CHANNEL=ses`` to select
the production SES adapter.

No email is actually sent. Every call emits a structlog ``email.sent`` event
at INFO level with the notification id, kind, recipient, and payload so that
local development and integration tests can assert on the log record.
